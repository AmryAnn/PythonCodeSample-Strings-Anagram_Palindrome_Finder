Version 0.1 - Released to unnamed persons for job application code assessment on 2/10/2022

This program is written with the intent to find words that are anagrams or palindromes parsed from a webpage.

To run this program: 
1. Download the files from this repository
2. From the command line (WSL/Bash), move to /anagram_palyndrome_finder/ and enter the following command:
			./AP_finder.bash -w "https://any.url.address/you/choose"

Expected Output - Printed to the terminal:
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Lists of anagram groups found on the webpage
- Any palindromes that were parsed.

Future Features:
- More organized output - Results in dictionary form saved to a file in addition to being printed to the terminal.

=======
- A list of all improper/proper anagrams for parsed words (currently limited to first five parsed words 
to save time).
- Any palindromes that were parsed.

Future Features:
- More organized output - All results in dictionary form saved to a file in addition to first five being 
printed to the terminal.
- Improved text clean-up prior to getting anagrams and finding palindromes.
- Anatree-type algorithm to find proper words for anagrams.
